# GarageDoor

  GarageDoor is an application created for ESP8266 boards, allowing you to remotely open and close your garage door.
  * GarageDoor will also send you push notifications to your phone when the door opens or closes using IFTTT Webhooks channel.
  * Push notification requires a magnetic reed switch to be installed and will work even if the door is operated manually.
  
  * The code was originally created for a Wemos D1 Mini board.
  
  * Enjoy!
